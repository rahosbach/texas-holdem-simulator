Poker Simulator

Overview
--------

This is a Jupyter notebook-based project that simulates Texas Holdem and Omaha poker games.
The user has the option of selecting how many players are in the game (2-10 players), and
which type of poker game it is (Holdem or Omaha).  Then, the notebook will run the game
for the specified number of iterations and keep track of each players' starting hands,
best hand-end hands, and the win/loss/split results.

The user can then visualize the results using heatmaps to show the win/split percentage
by starting hand or hand-end hand, based on the number of players in the game.

An example of the type of results and conclusions that can be drawn from this simulator
is located on the `questions and data`__ blog.
